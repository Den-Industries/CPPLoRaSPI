# CPPLoRaSPI
Files of code for working of Lora sx1278. Made for work on Orange Pi 5 but probably can work on Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers. Project made with use of codeblocks and CPP/C code. This project is basically modified compound of two libs, arduino-LoRa and spidev-lib. 
# For use
git clone https://github.com/Den-Industries/CPPLoRaSPI CPPLoRaSPI
and compile with some compilator like gcc(sorry I tired and will not copy commands, just use codeblocks please)
don't forget to add -lwiringPi in linker settings
Good luck!
