# CPPLoRaSPI
Files of code for working of Lora sx1278. Made for work on Orange Pi 5 but probably can work on Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers. Project made with use of codeblocks and CPP/C code. This project is basically modified compound of two libs, arduino-LoRa and spidev-lib. Good luck!
